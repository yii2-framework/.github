## 🚀 Extending Yii2 Lifespan in the Modern Era

Welcome to the community hub for the **modernization of the Yii2 Framework**.

This organization serves as the gateway to the **Next-Generation Ecosystem**: tools designed to integrate modern PHP 
standards, high-performance servers, and reactive UIs into your existing Yii2 applications.

### 🛠 The Ecosystem at a Glance

We are a coordinated effort providing enterprise-grade packages across the entire technology stack:

| Organization | Focus Area | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[yii2-extensions](https://github.com/yii2-extensions)** | **Backend Performance** | `FrankenPHP`, `RoadRunner`, `PSR-7/17`, `PHPStan` |
| **[UI Awesome](https://github.com/ui-awesome)** | **Frontend & UI** | `Tailwind CSS`, `Flowbite`, `daisyUI`, `HTML Components` |
| **[PHP Forge](https://github.com/php-forge)** | **Core Tools** | `Foxy` |

### ⚡ Why Modernize?

Don't rewrite your application from scratch; evolve it. Our packages allow you to:

1.  **Extreme Speed:** Run Yii2 on **FrankenPHP** or **RoadRunner** for 10x performance gains.
2.  **Code Quality:** Strict typing and ready for static analysis with PHPStan.
3.  **Modern UI:** Native "drop-in" support for **Flowbite** and **Tailwind CSS**.
